ItsMY_Messenger
Describe what the project does, what problem it solves, or what it is used for.

The goal of this project was to create a company messenger application, which allows users to send messages to each other. Each user logs into the application with their unique username and password, which follows a set of appropriate rules. Users can send messages with information about recipients, date and time sent, subject, and text. It was possible to send a message to one user. Each user had access to a list of sent and received messages, which could be deleted. The application data was stored in a database, and the program was configurable using a configuration file. The user interface was designed to be clear and allow for reasonable response to user errors.
Usage
The user starts the application just like any other .exe file. When prompted, the user can choose the desired activity to perform. This application is console-based, aiming to minimize distractions for employees.
